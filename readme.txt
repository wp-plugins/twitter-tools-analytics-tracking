= Why should I use this plugin? =

Generally hits from twitter will show up in Google Analytics as "Direct Traffic" - which means you can't measure the effectiveness of your Twitter profile. Tagging your traffic lets you measure the hits coming from Twitter effectively - see my [original post](http://www.leewillis.co.uk/tracking-twitter-traffic/) on the subject for more information.
